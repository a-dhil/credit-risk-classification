## Overview of the Analysis

* The dataset has a information about loan size, interest rate, borrow income, debt to income, number of accounts, derogatory marks, total debt and loan status. With all this information if the loan is granted or refused was predicted. Using  loan status as a target label.

* Loan Status was categorised as 0- healthy loan and 1- high-risk loan. Total count of healthy loan was 3653 and high risk loan was 1576. These values were reduced by dropping duplicate values as that was making data biased with too many values for loans granted.

* Generally the stages of machine learning include preprocessing, train, validate and predict. In this data the divided into features and target and then split in train and test model. Then followed by creating logistic regression model on original and resampled data.

* LogisticRegression() method was used to create a classification model to predict binary outcome .
## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
  * Description of Model 1 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.
  * Accuracy Sore: 
  * Precision Score:
  * Recall Score:


* Machine Learning Model 2:
  * Description of Model 2 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.
  * Accuracy Sore
  * Precision Score
  * Recall Score
## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:
* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
